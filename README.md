# The main purpose of the project is to implement a sampling strategy that collects a subset of samples of a signal defined over a graph and then reconstruct the original signal using only the subset. In our study case, an electromagnetic field is sampled over an area of a city and its power is represented over a graph matching the topology of the area. After verifying that the conditions to recover the signal holds, we used different functions in a greedy algorithm in order to choose the optimal sample set and reconstruct the signal
